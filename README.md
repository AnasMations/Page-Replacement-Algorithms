# Page Replacement Algorithms Visualization and Comparison

This repository contains a desktop application that visualizes and compares the behavior of different page replacement algorithms. The implemented algorithms are:

- First-In, First-Out (FIFO)
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Optimal (OPT)
- Least Frequently Used (LFU)
- Second Chance (SECOND CHANCE)

The desktop application is built using Python and PyQt6.

## Usage

To use the page replacement simulator, follow these steps:

1. Enter the page reference sequence in the input field. The sequence should be a string of integers separated by spaces.
2. Enter the number of frames in the input field.
3. Select the algorithm you want to use from the dropdown list.
4. Click the "Run Simulation" button to start the simulation.

The simulation will display the page frames and the page replacement process for the selected algorithm. The hit rate and fault rate will also be displayed.
